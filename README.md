# QRCodeGenerator
Quick Response (QR) codes seem to appear everywhere these days. We can see
them on posters, magazine ads, websites, product packaging and so on. Using the
QR codes is one of the most intriguing ways of digitally connecting consumers to
the internet via mobile phones, since the mobile phones have become a basic
necessity thing of everyone. In this project a application is made in which the users
enters a URL and get the QR code generated for the following.
Nowadays, all smart phones are with built in camera which are used to recognize the QR code. It s a
kind of URL shortening ways where the URL link turns into a QR code that, when scanned with a
mobile, camera, QR code reader or google lens, automatically direct users to the shortened link. It
really shows that QR codes are going to become more and more popular.

In the proposed system the application is used by users to convert the desired URL
in QR Code such as their social media handle, business information, etc.
Also any textual message can be encoded into a QR code and sent to different user.
The given proposed application shows the QR Code for direct scanning and
reaching the desired URL also in addition to that it saves the Code for later use like

Internet and mobile camera both contribute to easy and fast decoding of this QR
Codes and receiving the content in it.

QR code is now being widely used in a variety of businesses. QR code is a way of encoding more
information than a traditional bar code. And most importantly, it contains information that can be
easily decoded at high speed. In this project the QR codes are generated via the application that
facilitates users to easily create their own QR codes for websites, emails, business cards, print ads
and so on. The proposed method was developed using python s open source modules such as
tkinter , qrcode . The experimental results show that the QR codes were successfully and correctly
generated. Therefore, the proposed generator is considerably a easy use QR code generator as a
